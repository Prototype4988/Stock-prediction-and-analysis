Stock investments provide one of the highest returns in the market. Even though they are volatile in nature, one can visualise share prices and other statistical factors which helps the keen investors carefully decide on which company they want to spend their earnings on.   Developing this simple project idea using the Dash library (of Python), we can make dynamic plots of the financial data of a specific company by using the tabular data provided by yfinance python library. On top of it we can use a machine learning algorithm to predict the upcoming stock prices. This web application can be applied to any company (whose stock code is available) of one's choosing, so feel free to explore!
